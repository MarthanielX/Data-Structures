Contains two implementations of a Search Engine that recieves messy title/plot summary from IMDB (a from file passed in through run args), puts in into a map, and then allows the user to search it. One implementation is with a HashTable, the other is with a BST and allows for prefix searches. Also contains ...ToFile classes that run the loading of data multiple times in different ways and loads the differences in runtime and memory useage to a file.
